1. Switch stm is complex
- calculating the charge for one performance => extract function amountFor
- rename thisAmount variable
- rename perf param

2. Look at func amountFor() usage: the play param is from a calculation from performance
const play = plays[perf.playID];

=> play is a temp var in a loop 
=> play usage repeated a lot
=> replace temp var with query playFor(aPerformance)

- rename param perf -> aPerformance
- remove temp var, use inline func call playFor()
- remove redundant func param of amountFor: remove play param
